## 🔍 About the Project

This is a simple yet stylish **Palindrome Checker** built with vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to input any phrase or word, and instantly tells them whether it’s a palindrome—ignoring punctuation, casing, and spaces.

Designed with a **dark mode aesthetic**, this mini-app is as intuitive as it is elegant. It’s part of my learning journey through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and also a small gem in my **web development portfolio** 💎

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You type a word or phrase into the input box.
2. The script removes all non-alphanumeric characters and compares the cleaned string with its reversed version.
3. If both match → It’s a palindrome!
4. If not → Sorry, try again 🤓
